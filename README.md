# SEZKP â€” Space-efficient Zero-knowledge Proofs

This is a code repo that enables zero knowledge proofs to be generated with sublinear memory requirements. Traditionally, memory overhead has been a hindrance to widespread adoption of zero knowledge proof (ZKP) technology. As the length of a computational trace scales, so do the memory requirements of the prover. However, this project enables ZKP generation much more efficiently. This moves private computation from a centralized task reserved for specialized hardware to a task that is now feasible on edge devices and memory-constrained environments.

Have fun!
