//! Stream-friendly zero-knowledge masking helpers.
//!
//! We derive a small family of **low-degree random polynomials** from the
//! transcript (post column commitments, pre AIR queries) and add them to the
//! composition stream. This ensures the committed codeword is statistically
//! independent from the witness beyond what the transcript binds.
//!
//! Design goals:
//! - **Transcript-bound**: the prover and verifier both derive identical mask
//!   coefficients from the transcript only (no witness inputs).
//! - **Low degree**: each mask has a tiny fixed degree (e.g. 3), keeping the
//!   overall degree budget unchanged up to constants.
//! - **Stream friendly**: coefficients are derived once; evaluation at points
//!   `x` is done with Horner's rule using constant state.
//!
//! Usage pattern:
//! 1. Prover & verifier **both call** `derive_mask_coeffs` at the same point
//!    in the transcript schedule (we bind it after alphas, before row queries).
//! 2. Prover evaluates `R(x)` on the base domain (with `x = Ï‰^i`) and adds it
//!    into the composition value before streaming into the LDE/DEEP engine.
//! 3. Verifier does NOT need these values during the openings-only AIR check;
//!    it only needs to consume the same transcript challenges to remain in
//!    perfect sync with the prover for subsequent randomness draws.
